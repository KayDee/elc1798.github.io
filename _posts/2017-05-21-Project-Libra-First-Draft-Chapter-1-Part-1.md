## Prologue

Life is a strange thing. Full of twists and turns, full of monotonous and boring
routines, full of unexpected events. Mine just happened to be more fast paced
than most. But still, as I slowly fade away, I remain confused as to how things
turned out how they did, and even more confused about who I am, and how I feel
about the way I lived my life. My best friend, before she took her last breath,
told me that life was like a performance. You work your heart out practicing
and training. Then after a fleeting moment, all your efforts create something
beautiful, or end up not having any meaning at all. *Live to have no regrets.*

I don't know whether or not my efforts paid off or not. All I know is that I'm
tired of this ridiculously long life of mine. The number of regrets that I have
about my actions and decisions seems like an ocean compared to the number of
achievements that I'm proud of. But still, those miniscule moments seem to be
the only thing that kept me going for so long.

I've williningly tarnished my reputation and image. I've been branded as a devil
and a demon. I can't disagree with those titles after all I've done, but to some
extent, I enjoy it. The least I could do to atone for my sins was to take the
hits for those that gave me salvation.

Thousand of years from now, I hope the chronicles of our adventures fade away
with time, this civilization consumed by the next. I hope the same mistakes
aren't made again. But alas, of course, history will repeat itself. I leave
behind this manuscript to those who find it, in the hopes that the future will
learn from our mistakes.

## Chapter 1

I steeled my nerves as I took a step forward, raising my arm, preparing to
strike.

"Please... Please, I have a family! Don't do this!" My victim squirmed in the
corner of the room, eyes wide with fear. Her voice was quivering as she pleaded
more and more.

One more step forward. The muscles in my right arm tensed.

"Please, no! I promise! I'll give you as much money as you want! I'll make any
political decisions you want! Please, don't take me away from my family!"

She was crying, her mind breaking. I could feel the turmoil in her mind, as she
struggled to accept her impending death.

One more step forward. I was within striking distance now. Her pleas and cries
seemed louder and unending. I shifted the grip on the handle of my katana.

"Please, no! No! NO! N-"

*Shkk!* The blood splattered on the wall as I slashed her throat. I stood still
for a moment, as it was suddenly silent. No more cries, no more scrambling
thoughts, nor more screaming.

Peace and quiet. *How tranquil.* A light breeze came through the window, the
moonlight illuminating the mess that was the study. Papers and books scattered
on the floor, chairs and desks flipped over. I waded through the mess and
exitted the room, walking down the hallway strewn with the bodies of all the
guards that I'd killed just minutes ago.

I walked out the front door of the mansion and stopped.

"The mission?" A rough, deep, masculine voice sounded from my left.

"Completed. No survivors. The message was delivered." I responded in a calm
tone.

"Good work, Fem. Let's head to the pickup location." The captain boosted himself
off the wall he was leaning on and leapt forward, walking down the path towards
the forest.

I stayed still for a little longer, basking under the comfort of the moonlight.
Taking a deep breath, I looked down at my left hand. Symbols appeared in glowing
white glyphs. *r=1.04. t=2.599e12*. Not bad. I started breathing normally again
as I followed the captain into the forest.

**----**

President Cathleen Brian. Newly elected political figure. Extremely high public
ratings. Mother of 3 kids, and sister of another well known politician. Also my
latest victim.

I've been an assassin for several years now. Part of a criminal syndicate that
strived to disrupt any peace or stagnation that may occur throughout the world.
Political figures, religious leaders, business leaders, corporations, and even
superheroes were among our many targets. Throughout our civilization's long
history, we have caused many historical... events, many of which have had
enormous impacts on human history. To the world, we were known simply as The
Revenants. Why? Because every time the organization is supposedly squashed or
destroyed, we appear again, only to cause more chaos.

After the truck picked me and the Captain up at the rendezvous site, I was
brought to a safe house. Walking in, I beelined towards my room. *4 people. 1
upstairs, 3 in the living room.* As I walked past the living room, a loud
obnoxious voice hollered at me.

"Hey Fem! How'd it go?"

I ignored him and kept walking towards my room. Azazel sprung out of the couch
and ran at me.

"Stop giving me the cold shoulder babe! Talk to me!" He put his hand on my
shoulder.

*Thud!* He dropped on the floor as I spun around swept his feet from under him
and shove his chest downwards.

"I'm not *babe*, Azazel. I'm your teammate, nothing more, nothing less. And stop
putting on the drunk person act. It's annoying." I said in a low voice into his
ear.

"Alright, fine. How was the mission? You took a bit longer than usual. You
aren't losing your touch are you?" He said, in a serious tone, worlds apart than
his "drunk football jock" voice from before. **If you're losing your touch, I
*will* kill you.**

"Don't worry about it. I wanted some alone time. It was nice out tonight." I
stood up and held my hand out. He ignored it and propped himself off the ground.
He walked back into the living room. **I know you can hear me, bitch. Get out of
my head.**

I smiled. *If you'd stop thinking so loudly, it'd be easier.* I responded,
telepathically. I went up to the door of my room, and gripped the doorknob. The
lock clicked and released as the biometric scanners on the knob verified my
identity. Twisting it open, I pushed the oak-disguised steel door open, and shut
it behind me.

My room was pretty spartan, like most private rooms in any of the safe houses
across the world. A bed with plane white sheets, a non-descript lamp, and a
small wooden desk and chair were the only pieces of furniture in the tiny room.
Looking around, I found a closet on the east wall, and a door leading to a
private bathroom on the north wall. I opened the closet on the right side of the
room. A few changes of clothes, as well as some extra gear were inside. I took a
set of clothes out, and went into the bathroom.

I took off my sweat-clad clothes and propped my sword on the wall. I set my
utility belt, filled with knives, poison needles, and other lethal things, on
the sink counter, and stepped into the shower.

I stood there, leaning on the wall as the comfort of the hot water washed away
the toils of the day and night. I closed my eyes and put my face under the
showerhead, shutting off my senses. I felt... uncomfortable. Today was my 82nd
assassination. But after years of murder and ruthless killing, I still felt the
same strange sensation that I felt 3 years ago.

I was taught to kill my emotions. Any feelings or emotions that I portrayed must
be an act, with the purpose of manipulation to increase the chance of success of
the mission. But as a telepath, much the strength of many of my abilities comes
from emotion. As such, I had to compromise by bottling up any feelings I felt,
and letting them out when I needed them.

I moved my face away from the showerhead and gasped for air. I leaned on the
wall and slowly slid downwards until I was sitting on the shower floor. I put
The warmth of the steady spray of water on my breast, above my heart, felt
comforting as took deep breaths, trying to calm down. The strange sensation, the
strange knot I felt in my heart and the dull ache that emanated from my core
throughtout my body with every heartbeat, slowly went away.

**----**

I sprawled onto my bed, pulling the puffy, warm blankets over my body, still
warm and comfortable from the hot shower. The fake silk pajamas felt nice on my
skin as I hugged the pillow. I grabbed my phone the desk next to the bed, and
checked for notifications: 2 new messages.

Pretty standard stuff. I set an alarm for 6:30 A.M. and shut off my phone. I
turned the desk lamp off, and pulled the blanket over my head.

**----**

I was in car, turned on its side. Broken glass littered the area around me.
The dim light from the street lamps cast an eerie glow on me as I sat there on
my knees. I was frozen. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't move a single
muscle. I simply sat there, unable to avert my gaze from the scene in front of
me. A man and a woman, struggling and screaming as masked figures, clad in
black, violently retrained them. I saw one of the 3 assailants shove a rag over
the woman's mouth. Immediately, the woman went limp as she lost consciousness,
her long black hair covering her face as one of the other assailants threw her
over his shoulder, and began carrying away. The man yelled out, fighting even
harder to escape, but the black figure had an iron grip on his arms. The one
with the rag walked over and threw a hard punch into his stomach, causing him to
keel over, his yells cut short as he was winded. The assailant shoved the rag
over his mouth and, like the woman, he became still as he lost consciousness. A
van appeared from around the corner, and the assailants, carrying the man and
the woman like sacks of rice over their shoulders, boarded the van through the
rear door and disappeared into the night.

*Bzz!* The vibration from my phone against the desk jolted me awake. I grabbed
the phone and dismissed the alarm. Rolling over, I hugged the pillow as I fought
with myself internally to get out of bed. *That dream again.* I pushed my face
into the pillow.  *Huh? The pillow's wet?* I sat up and rubbed my eyes. *Was I
crying again?* I lay back down onto the bed and started at the ceiling.

*Mom. Dad. Where are you now?*

I got out of bed and walked into the bathroom, the cold morning air a stark
difference from the warm blankets and sheets I had left. I hugged myself and
rubbed my arms as I scurried across the cold floor in bare feet. I stared at
myself in the bathroom mirror. My eyes were bloodshot, my hair was a mess, and
my skin felt disgusting. Turning the faucet on, I splashed water on my face and
rubbed the cool water into my eyes. Gradually, I became more and more awake as
the soft touch of the water seeped through my closed eyes. I grabbed the towel
next to the sink and smothered my face with it. I took a moment to relax: the
soft drumming of the water hitting the sink, the feeling of the furry bathroom
mat under my feet, and the rough, but comforting touch of the towel against my
face. Taking long, deep breaths, I slowly wiped the dampness on my face.

*A week to kick back and relax... what should I do?* I set the towel aside and
began to brush my teeth. *Maybe if Orthus and the rest are free too, we could
all go out together.* I stared blankly at myself in the mirror. *Last time we
were all out together... when was that? A month ago? 2?* I spat out the
toothpaste and rinsed out my mouth. *Maybe we could go grab dinner later. That
Italian place downtown seemed pretty nice.*

"Hey Fem! Your package is here." A voice came from outside my door.

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and walked over. Opening the door, I
saw Orthus standing there in a wrinkled T-shirt and sweatpants, with a small
briefcase in his hand.

"Hey Orth." I took the briefcase as he handed it to me. "Thanks."

"Hey Fem, it's Nero's birthday soon. I figured we were all free for the next few
days. Maybe we could get dinner together." Orthus leaned on the wall in a very
relaxed fashion.

"Oh yeah, sure! That'll be great!" I mentally reprimanded myself for forgetting
about Nero. "Yeah I'm free until next Tuesday."

"Cool." Orthus boosted himself off the wall, in his usual whimsical fashion.
"Yeah Nero wanted to go to that fried chicken place. Maybe grab a couple beers.
It'll be fun." He ran his hand through his jet black hair and let out a yawn,
clearly not yet completely awake.

*Did you just wake up?* I unintentionally asked him telepathically.

"Yeah, fell asleep on the living room couch last night. The delivery guy woke me
up." He blinked hard a few times and raised both of his arms, stretching his
back. "Anyway, Andromalus says he'll try to make it. Isaac is coming too, Azazel
says he'll show up, and I think Lucia told Nero she was going. It'll be nice,
having the whole crew together again."

*Yeah, it would be. It's been a long time since we've gotten together.*

"Yeah it really has. It's tomorrow at 7 ish. We'll meet by the park like usual."
He shifted backwards, starting to leave. "Alright, I should get going. Azazel,
Nero, and Isaac all have rooms upstairs. I'm down the hall.  Lucia is flying in
tonight I think."

*Nice, thanks. See you around.* I shut the door on him as he waved goodbye and
walked away.

Our names: Andromalus, Orthus, Azazel, Isaac, Nero, Lucia, and Fem, were
codenames given to us by the upper echelon. Our real names were kept hidden from
everyone, including central command and each other. We used assigned fake
identities, like the one in the briefcase I was holding, for day-to-day
activities.

I walked over to the bed and threw the briefcase on it. *I'll open you later.*
Grabbing the pair of jeans I had from yesterday, I went into the pocket and took
out another smartphone. A bunch of social media notifications popped up as it
connected to the internet, mostly Facebook updates, news, and Reddit posts.
Flicking through, I saw a "Breaking News" headline article: "Presidant Brian
Assassinated! IPF and FMA in Joint Investigation!" *So the news has been spread
already... What'll happen now?* The IPF was the International Police Force, a
law enforcement agency that had international jurisdiction and military power.
The FMA was the Federal Metahuman Association, a society of humans who, like me,
had some form of mutation or superpower. These powers were dubbed "metas", and
all legal metahuman citizens had to be registered with the FMA. The FMA has the
highest decision making power for any metahuman-related event or policy, whether
it be a law, a crime investigation, or judicial hearing. The FMA was divided
into several divisions, the main ones being the Internal, Public, and Military
divisions. The Internal division dealt with matters related to anything
contained within the metahuman society, and the Public division dealt with any
matters related to interactions between metahumans and the rest of the world.

The Military division was the most well-known throughout the world. Non-meta
humans treated them as superheros: a not particularly large, but sizable group
of metahumans who choose to use their metas for law enforcement and public
safety. Metahumans treated them as just another police force. *A joint
investigation between the IPF and the FMA would probably mean involvement of the
Public and Military divisions.* I stared at the news article on my phone. *If
any of us got into a battle with the FMA Military, would we make it out alive?*
I skimmed the rest of the article: "suspected involvment of Revenants", "tire
tracks discovered in nearby woods", and "18 dead security guards" were among key
phrases I picked up.

I let out an exasperated sigh and jumped onto my bed.

## Chapter 1

"Please... Please, I have a family! Don't do this!" My victim squirmed in the
corner of the room, eyes wide with fear. Her voice was quivering as she pleaded
more and more.

*Sorry. Orders are orders.*

"Please, no! I promise! Do you want money? Do you want political power?  Please,
don't take me away from my family!"

*I don't want money. Or political money. What I want is...*

She was crying, her mind breaking. I could feel the turmoil of her thoughts, as she
struggled to accept her impending death.

I took a step forward, well within striking distance. Her pleas and cries seemed
louder and unending. I spun my oversized butterfly knife from a reverse grip to
a forward one, sending a jarring metallic ringing through the room. Her eyes
went wide.

"Please, no! No! NO! N-"

I lunged forward and stabbed her throat, cutting her screams short and impaling
her into the wall. I kept my arm there, holding the blade in place as she tried
pulling it out, cutting her hands up in the process. She sputtered, gasping for
air as she spat out blood. The light left her eyes, wide from terror and shock,
as her body slumped, her bleeding hands falling to the ground with a thump.

It was silent. No more cries, no more scrambling thoughts, no more screaming.

Peace and quiet. *How tranquil.* A light breeze came through the ajar window,
the moonlight illuminating the mess that was the study. Papers and books
scattered on the floor, chairs and desks flipped over. I waded through the mess
and left the room, walking down the hallway strewn with the bodies of
unconscious guards.

I walked out the front door of the mansion and stopped.

"The mission?" A rough, deep, masculine voice sounded from my left.

"Completed. President Brian is dead. The message was delivered." I responded in
a calm tone.

"Good work, Fem. Let's head to the pickup location." The captain boosted himself
off the wall he was leaning on and leapt forward, walking down the path towards
the forest.

I stayed still for a little longer, basking under the comfort of the moonlight.
Taking a deep breath, I looked down at my left hand. Symbols appeared in glowing
white glyphs. *r=1.04. t=1.923696e15*. Not bad. I started breathing normally again
as I followed the captain into the forest.

**----**

After the truck picked me and the Captain up at the rendezvous site, I was
brought to a safe house. Walking in, I beelined towards my room. *4 people. 1
upstairs, 3 in the living room.* As I walked past the living room, a loud
obnoxious voice hollered at me.

"Hey Fem! How'd it go?"

I ignored him and kept walking towards my room. He sprung up and walked towards
me.

"You okay?" He looked at me with a slightly concerned look.

*I'm fine. Just tired.* I told him telepathically.

"Alright. Orthus and Isaac are here too. Nero's sleeping upstairs."

*I know. Thanks Az.*

I went up to the door of my room, and gripped the doorknob. The
lock clicked and released as the biometric scanners on the knob verified my
identity. Twisting it open, I pushed the oak-disguised steel door open, and shut
it behind me.

My room was pretty spartan, like most private rooms in any of the safe houses
across the world. A bed with plane white sheets, a non-descript lamp, and a
small wooden desk and chair were the only pieces of furniture in the tiny room.
Looking around, I found a closet on the east wall, and a door leading to a
private bathroom on the north wall. I opened the closet on the right side of the
room. A few changes of clothes, as well as some extra gear, were inside. I took a
set of clothes out, and went into the bathroom.

I took off my sweat-clad clothes and dropped my knives on the ground with a
thud as the steel hit the ceramic tiles. Opening the glass door, I stepped into
the shower.

I stood there, leaning on the window in front of me as the hot water hit my
back, slowly washing away my discomfort. I turned my head slightly and looked
through the glass door at the pair of knives on the floor: two oversized,
approximately 1 foot long, steel butterfly knives. The metal was slightly
tarnished, with some blacked out patches on the handle, but the blade was shiny
as new.

I closed my eyes and turned around, putting my face under the showerhead,
shutting off my senses. President Cathleen Brian. Newly elected political
figure. Extremely high public ratings. The public loved her political standpoint
and her achievements, given her charisma on the podium, but her private life was
a completely different story. Mother of 3 kids, and sister of another well known
politician. She was married to a wealthy businessman, but was having an affair
with a state senator she had gone to college with. Twenty years ago, she
secretly funded a gang involved in drug dealing and human trafficking, known as
The Gold Miners, in exchange for Stupor: an illegal drug that amplifies metagene
effects. She was also my 82nd victim.

I had a uncomfortable feeling in my gut: one that I couldn't put a name on. But
after so many missions, I still had that same exact sensation that I did during
my first one so many years ago, even if my targets were "secret criminals".

When I was trained, I was taught to kill my emotions. Any feelings or emotions
that I portrayed must be an act, with the purpose of manipulation to increase
the chance of success of the mission. But as a telepath, much the strength of
many of my abilities comes from emotion. As such, I had to compromise by
bottling up any feelings I felt, treating them as a tool, letting them out only
when I needed to.

I turned away from the showerhead and gasped for air. I leaned on the windows
and slowly slid downwards until I was sitting on the shower floor. The warmth of
the steady spray of water on my breast, above my heart, felt comforting as took
deep breaths, trying to calm down. The strange sensation, the strange knot I
felt in my heart and the dull ache that emanated from my core throughtout my
body with every heartbeat, slowly went away.

**----**

I sprawled onto my bed, pulling the puffy, warm blankets over my body, still
warm and comfortable from the hot shower. The fake silk pajamas felt nice on my
skin as I hugged the pillow. I grabbed my phone the desk next to the bed, and
checked for notifications: 2 new messages.

Somehow, not necessarily by force and not necessarily by choice either, I ended
up as part of an organization called the Revenants: an underground society of
assassins, killers, and what-have-you.

I set an alarm for 6:30 A.M. and shut off my phone. I turned the desk lamp off,
and pulled the blanket over my head.

**----**

I was in car, turned on its side. Broken glass littered the area around me.
The dim light from the street lamps cast an eerie glow on me as I sat there on
my knees. I was frozen. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't move a single
muscle. I simply sat there, unable to avert my gaze from the scene in front of
me. A man and a woman, struggling and screaming as masked figures, clad in
black, violently retrained them. I saw one of the 3 assailants shove a rag over
the woman's mouth. Immediately, the woman went limp as she lost consciousness,
her long black hair covering her face as one of the other assailants threw her
over his shoulder, and began carrying away. The man yelled out, fighting even
harder to escape, but the black figure had an iron grip on his arms. The one
with the rag walked over and threw a hard punch into his stomach, causing him to
keel over, his yells cut short as he was winded. The assailant shoved the rag
over his mouth and, like the woman, he became still as he lost consciousness. A
van appeared from around the corner, and the assailants, carrying the man and
the woman like sacks of rice over their shoulders, boarded the van through the
rear door and disappeared into the night.

*Bzz!* The vibration from my phone against the desk jolted me awake. I grabbed
the phone and dismissed the alarm. Rolling over, I hugged the pillow as I fought
with myself internally to get out of bed. *That dream again.* I pushed my face
into the pillow.  *Huh? The pillow's wet?* I sat up and rubbed my eyes. *Was I
crying again?* I lay back down onto the bed and started at the ceiling.

*Mom. Dad. Where are you now?*

I got out of bed and walked into the bathroom, the cold morning air a stark
difference from the warm blankets and sheets I had left. I hugged myself and
rubbed my arms as I scurried across the cold floor in bare feet. I stared at
myself in the bathroom mirror. My eyes were bloodshot, my hair was a mess, and
my skin felt disgusting. Turning the faucet on, I splashed water on my face and
rubbed the cool water into my eyes. Gradually, I became more and more awake as
the soft touch of the water seeped through my closed eyes. I grabbed the towel
next to the sink and smothered my face with it. I took a moment to relax: the
soft drumming of the water hitting the sink, the feeling of the furry bathroom
mat under my feet, and the rough, but comforting touch of the towel against my
face. Taking long, deep breaths, I slowly wiped the dampness on my face.

*A week to kick back and relax... what should I do?* I set the towel aside and
began to brush my teeth. *Maybe if Orthus and the rest are free too, we could
all go out together.* I stared blankly at myself in the mirror. *Last time we
were all out together... when was that? A month ago? 2?* I spat out the
toothpaste and rinsed out my mouth. *Maybe we could go grab dinner later. That
Italian place downtown seemed pretty nice.*

"Hey Fem! Your package is here." A voice came from outside my door.

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and walked over. Opening the door, I
saw Orthus standing there in a wrinkled T-shirt and sweatpants, with a small
briefcase in his hand.

"Hey Orth." I took the briefcase as he handed it to me. "Thanks."

As I was shutting the door, he put his arm out and propped it open.

"Hey Fem, it's Nero's birthday soon. I figured we were all free for the next few
days. Maybe we could get dinner together." Orthus leaned on the wall in a very
relaxed fashion.

"Oh yeah, sure! That'll be great!" I mentally reprimanded myself for forgetting
about such an important day. "Yeah I'm free until next Tuesday."

"Cool." Orthus boosted himself off the wall, in his usual whimsical fashion.
"Yeah Nero wanted to go to that fried chicken place. Maybe grab a couple beers.
It'll be fun." He ran his hand through his jet black hair and let out a yawn,
clearly not yet completely awake.

*Did you just wake up?* I unintentionally asked him telepathically.

"Yeah, fell asleep on the living room couch last night. The delivery guy woke me
up." He blinked hard a few times and raised both of his arms, stretching his
back. "Anyway, Andromalus says he'll try to make it. Isaac is coming too, Azazel
says he'll show up, and I think Lucia told Nero she was going. It'll be nice,
having the whole crew together again."

*Yeah, it would be. It's been a long time since we've gotten together.*

"Yeah it really has. It's tomorrow at 7 ish. We'll meet by the park like usual."
He shifted backwards, starting to leave. "Alright, I should get going. Azazel,
Nero, and Isaac all have rooms upstairs. I'm down the hall.  Lucia is flying in
tonight I think."

*Nice, thanks. See you around.* I shut the door on him as he waved goodbye and
walked away.

Our names: Andromalus, Orthus, Azazel, Isaac, Nero, Lucia, and Fem, were
codenames given to us by the upper echelon of the Revenants. Our real names were
kept hidden from everyone, including central command and each other. We used
assigned fake identities, like the one in the briefcase I was holding, for
day-to-day activities.

I walked over to the bed and threw the briefcase on it. *I'll open you later.*
Grabbing the pair of jeans I had from yesterday, I went into the pocket and took
out another smartphone. A bunch of social media notifications popped up as it
connected to the internet, mostly Facebook updates, news, and Reddit posts.
Flicking through, I saw a "Breaking News" headline article: "Presidant Brian
Assassinated! IPF and AMP in Joint Investigation!" *So the news has been spread
already... What'll happen now?* The IPF was the International Police Force, a
law enforcement agency that had international jurisdiction and military power.
The AMP was the Association for Metahuman Policy, a society of humans who, like
me, had some form of mutation or superpower. These powers were dubbed "metas",
and all legal metahuman citizens had to be registered with the AMP. The AMP had
the highest decision making power for any metahuman-related event or policy,
whether it be a law, a crime investigation, or judicial hearing. The AMP was
divided into several divisions, the main ones being the Internal, Public, and
Military divisions. The Internal division dealt with matters related to anything
contained within the metahuman society, and the Public division dealt with any
matters related to interactions between metahumans and the rest of the world.

The Military division was the most well-known throughout the world. Non-meta
humans treated them as superheros: a not particularly large, but sizable group
of metahumans who choose to use their metas for law enforcement and public
safety. Metahumans treated them as just another police force. *A joint
investigation between the IPF and the AMP would probably mean involvement of the
Public and Military divisions.* I stared at the news article on my phone. *If
any of us got into a battle with the AMP Military, would we make it out alive?*
I skimmed the rest of the article: "suspected involvment of Revenants", "tire
tracks discovered in nearby woods", "only President Brian dead", and "all
security guards found unconscious, but unharmed" were among key phrases I picked
up.

I let out an exasperated sigh and jumped onto my bed. There wasn't any point
worrying about it now. The job was done. If we got caught and were confronted,
it would be up to us get out of the situation. The organization known as the
Revenants gave us all a second chance, and all of us knew were wouldn't get a
third. Almost nine years ago, my parents were attacked by a foreign military
group from the Confederacy of Zuxia. They were scientists who were researching
the cause of metahumans - dubbed 'metagens' or 'metagenes'. One day, on a car
ride back home from dinner, our car was hit by a truck, carrying a large amount
of flammable liquid. After the safety mechanisms of the car engaged and our car
stopped flipping and rolling, three men wearing masks and what I later learned
to be Zuxian military uniforms came out and dragged my parents out from our
totalled car, which was flipped over and on fire, sedating them and taking them
away.

I was barely conscious, in the back seat as I watched everything unfold, and I
remember after police and ambulances arrived, I learned that my right wrist was
badly sprained and my skull had a hairline fracture. For the next few months, I
was in shock. Eventually I was let out of the hospital and put under foster care
for about four months. Days had flown by where I did done nothing but sit on my
bed. It was also then when my telepathic powers started to flare up more and
more. Before, I used to just barely be able to talk to a single person for no
more than a few sentences. But as the days went by, and after many days of just
sitting with thoughts flying around in my head, I slowly learned to use my
abilities more and more.

At nights, I would enter the minds of the people in the house: my foster
parents, and their 2 non-adopted kids. I enjoyed looking in to people's dreams,
experiencing the worlds that their minds created: a medieval world where an 8
year old boy saved the princess, a mom opening a letter of early admission from
Harvard.

Then one night, when I started to have flashbacks of the night my parents were
kidnapped, I broke down as reality caught up to me, like throwing a sucker punch
right into my face. My telepathy went rampant throughout the house, as I
unintentionally pushed my unsuppressed emotions into everyone's dreams. Not only
did the induced nightmares and mental pain snap everyone awake, but my foster
parent's 4 year old son went crazy, and in an attempt to make the pain stop,
jumped out the window of his second floor bedroom, snapping his neck.  The
moment I heard his mother scream in terror and felt her own thoughts and
emotions fly through my brain, I ran. I ran right out the front door in my
pajamas, my mind in panic, fear, and terror. I ran down block after block,
street after street. I didn't know how long I ran before I stopped at a tree to
prop myself up, both out of breath and in disgust, and threw up. I sunk down to
the ground: a 9 year old, covered in filth, a mind in terror, an orphan, and now
a murderer. I tried to catch my breath, and at that moment, I had truly wished
to die.

I sat there, at the base of the tree, next to a puddle of vomit, with my eyes
glazed over. As I heard sirens coming from the direction of the house and police
car lights streaking through the darkness of the night sky, someone walked up
behind me and tapped my shoulder.

"Hey little girl. Are you alright?"

And nine-year-old me looked up and saw the man that I now call Captain.

**----**

The buzz of the city was always impressive to me. The sheer number of people,
the noise, the chatter, and the enormous amounts of thoughts: parents worrying
about their kids at school, students cutting class worrying about their parents
finding out, tourists being amazed by every sight they saw, shop owners mentally
screaming at frustrating customers. It was almost impossible for me to function.
The briefcase that Orthus had brought me contained a passport, credit card, and
SIM card. My alias was "Alice Nakamura": Revenant usually issued fake identities
that matched our actual nationalities. In my case, my father was from Nihon, and
my mother was Parisia. Close enough.

I wore a loose fitting grey T-shirt, a pair of blue denim short shorts, and a
black sneakers. My ponytail was twisted into a loose bun, held together with a
hair clip, with a long, thin strip of hair flowing down the left side of my
face. The hot summer sun beamed down on me. *Ugh... it's so hot.* I walked
around some more, trying to find something interesting to do. I checked the time
on my phone: 12:17 PM.  *I should get some lunch soon, probably. Where am I
right now?* I looked around for a street sign. *44th and 8th, huh? Wasn't that
Italian place on 42nd and 8th?* I walked down two blocks, wading through many a
tourist group until I saw the place: La Trattoria Euphoria.

"Hello there, young lady, would that be a table for one?" The waiter greeted me
as I entered.

"Yes please, thank you."

The waiter nodded and grabbed a menu, leading me to a table in the corner, by a
window and a wall. The inside of the restaurant had a rustic, yet refined feel.
The walls were old red brick, with jagged edges, and had dim lights affixed to
them. The tables were polished oak wood, with wooden, non-cushioned chairs.
Several polished silver chandeliers hung from the ceiling, emitting a light
barely noticeable compared to the sunlight flooding through from the windows. A
gentle aroma wafted from the kitchen, the scent of different pasta sauces did a
good job of whetting my appetite. The restaurant itself was quite noisy, akin to
a diner during lunch hours. Instinctively, I looked around at the people,
obseriving them. There was a group of old ladies on the far side of the room,
talking about their children and grandchildren. At another table sat two men in
suits, on a lunch break from work. Several tables of tourists. A table of high
schoolers who came out to eat for their lunch break.

I took a look at the menu. After mulling it over, I put the menu back down and
looked behind me, out the window. I closed my eyes and focused. I let my mind
open up, allowing the thoughts of everyone within 30 meters of me to coalesce
with my own. The effect was overwhelming: it took weeks of practice just to not
instantly lose consciousness when reading from only 5 people's minds. Right now,
there were around 80 people passing in and out of my telepathic range. Among
those, I caught the thought of a waiter, wondering if he should come to my table
to take my order. I giggle a bit and put my mental gates back up, blocking out
all the thoughts. Opening my eyes, I acted as if I were looking around for a
waiter. The waiter who's mind I'd just probed came briskly walking towards my
table.

"Hello there, young miss, my name is Mike and I'll be taking care of you today.
Are you ready to order?" He looked Italian, probably in his early twenties, thin
but fit, with his jet black hair slicked back with hair gel. He took a pad and
pen out from his apron pocket.

"Yes, please. Can I have an order of fried calamari to start, and a plate of
linguini with white clam sauce?"

"Alright, for the linguini, would you like the lunch portion or the dinner
portion?" he asked, scribbling down the order.

"Lunch portion, please. Thank you." I handed him the menu.

"Alrighty, I'll bring out some bread so you can get started." He took the menu
and trotted away towards the kitchen area.

I sipped on my water while looking at my phone, browsing through social media.
The public reaction towards President Brian's assassination was one of pure
outrage. Her brother, Councilman Patrick Brian, had issued a public statement,
saying that the IPF and AMP joint investigation was their top priority to bring
justice on the Revenants. Meanwhile, Vice President Camilla Dustine was given
the title of President in light of the assassination.

Mike walked over carrying a basket of bread and a plate with butter servings. I
smiled at him and gave him a nod of thanks. I picked up a piece of bread and
began to spread butter over it.

*Hmm... is there something fun I can do today?* I took a few slow bites of the
bread and absentmindedly began to twirl the butter knife in my hand. There
wasn't much that entertained me anymore. There were quite a few movie theaters
in the city, but there weren't any movies that were worth watching. Most of the
ones playing were remakes of old films or sequels of "bad but good" action
movies. The nearest amusement park was a while away, and I didn't want to ask
for a ride to go that far. I could go back to my room and laze about, watching
internet videos and take a few naps.

My train of thought was suddenly interrupted by a loud, obnoxious laughter.
A man, probably in his early thirties or late twenties, had walked into the
restaurant. He wore a sloppy suit, rumpled and crinkled pretty much everywhere.
He had 2 girls with him, one under each arm.

*This guy can't be serious...* His hands were dangerously high up on the girls'
waists, almost to the point of grabbing their breasts. One of the girls, the
blonde on his right, looked like a typical gold digger: face full of makeup,
glittery clothes, a skirt that was just barely covered her... behind, and
covered in jewelry. On the other hand, both literally and figuratively, the
brunette girl on his left looked like she definitely didn't want to be there.
She was dressed much more modestly, a thin wool sweater draped over her upper
body, and a pair of typical summer short shorts. Her hands were on his arm,
trying to push his hand lower or away.

*Typical Grade-A pervert money-douche.* I opened up my mind again, focusing on
this new group that was just being seated a few tables to my right. The blonde
was still glued to the guy's arm. The brunette managed to escape his grasp and
sat down across from the others.

"*His cologne fucking reeks. And his hand is way too high. But eh, free shit is
free shit.*" The blonde's name was Camille. Damn this girl has no self respect.

"*Why am I doing this? Who's this 'Camille' girl? I want to go home.*" The
brunette's name was Blaire. Apparently Mr. Grade-A Douchebag asked her on a date
and surprised her by bringing another girl, and acting completely differently
than how she first met him.

"*Damn, this girl has nice tits. She looks hot for it too. Maybe I should invite
her back, go all the way.*" Fabien D'Angelo. There was nothing angelic about
him. He was a spoiled rich-boy, a pervert, and straight up despicable. The kind
of person I hate the most. Delving into his mind almost made me puke. Not only
that... he was a meta. Above-human levels of strength, superhuman levels of
regeneration, and able to generate immense heat with his hands. I looked up from
my phone, where I looked him up on the AMP Citizen Registry. His powers were
pretty common ones, though having them all together made him slightly more
special than other metas.

Just then, Mike came over with a plate of calamari.

"And here you are, enjoy young miss." He said in a very formal, gentlemanly
tone. He set the plate down on my table and scurried away to a table waving him
over. I stuck my fork in a piece of fried squid and put it in my mouth after
dipping it in the tomato sauce. *I guess I have something mildly amusing to do
today.* Chewing slowly, I savored the flavor of the meal. It was pretty rare for
me to eat out: most of the time, I cooked something quick and simple or ate
whatever the safehouse fridge had inside it. The calamari was quite crispy on
the outside and the squid had a slightly rubbery texture. It was pretty good,
though I've always had a thing for fried calamari, so it might have just been my
personal bias.

I sat there slowly eating my calamari and took out my phone. I browsed around
for nearby hotels, and found one about 20 minutes out of the city that wasn't
too expensive for a night. From my phone, I booked a cheap room for tonight.
As I finished up the payment, Mike walked over again with a steaming plate of
linguini.

"Linguini with white clam sauce, would you like some pepper with that?" He
asked, setting down the plate in front of me and took out the pepper grinder he
had been clutching under his arm.

"Yes please. And could you bring the check now? I'd prefer to pay a bit earlier
if that's okay with you."

"Alright, will do." He replied, while turning the pepper grinder, sprinkling
pepper over my pasta. I nodded and motioned for him to stop, and he put the
grinder back under his arm as he went back to grab the check. I quickly ate the
rest of the calamari, and refocused my attention back onto Fabien, Camille, and
Blaire. Douchebag had made his way up and was full on grabbing Camille's breast
now. Her hand was on top of his, either trying to cover up his scandalous
actions or keeping his hand there. *What the fuck, is she getting off to this
shit?* Across the table, Blaire was averting her gaze, her face begging to flush
red.

"*What the hell, man? I didn't know he was like this...*" Her discomfort was
showing even more now, her legs crossed, firmly squeezing together

*If this is bothering you, just leave.* I spoke to her telepathically. Her eyes
widened a bit and her face morphed into a slightly more puzzled expression. Most
people, when spoken to telepathically without warning, tend to brush it off as
mentally talking to themselves. She seemed to steel up a bit, her expression
changing to one of both disappointment and relief. She grabber her phone from
the table, got up, and walked towards the exit.

As soon as she did, Fabien opened up his mouth to call her back, springing up
from his seat. *Look to your left.* I pushed a thought into his mind, causing
him to not say anything, and turn to his left to see me slurping up a strand of
my pasta, looking directly at him.

"*Oh? What do we have here?*" He made eye contact with me and stared at me for a
few seconds. Some of the people around him started laughing quietly to
themselves, and when Camille tugged on his arm, he broke his gaze and sat back
down. "*Fuck it, Blaire can go fuck off wherever. That chick over there
though...*"

I smiled to myself. *Game over.*

When Mike finally brought the check over, I paid with my card. This place was
surprisingly cheap for an Italian restaurant in the middle of the city. When I
got the receipt and a pen, I wrote the address of the hotel and my room number
on a napkin, along with writing '9:00 PM' at the bottom. As I was finishing up
my lunch, I kept glancing at him to see if he would steal glances at me.
Occasionally, we made eye contact and I would smile at him whenever we did.

When I finished my meal, I got up and folded up the napkin, keeping it between
my fingers. I left Mike a fairly large tip, and walked towards the exit, but
passed by Fabien's table. As I walked by, right as he was opening his mouth
to say something, I dropped the napkin in front of him and continued walking.
Telepathically, I could feel him unfolding it, reading it, and smiling to
himself. I glanced back at him staring at me, smiled back, and left the
restaurant.  *Damn, I'm such a bitch.*

I left the restaurant at around 1 P.M., my heart beating like a machine gun, so
much so that it hurt. I turned the corner and leaned my back on the wall of the
first building. I took a few deep breaths, clutching my chest with my both
hands. It took a few moments for the adrenaline rush to subside, and my heart to
slow down to a normal rate. A few passersby gave me concerned looks, which I
dispelled by giving them a weak smile and waving them on. Nowadays, it was rare
for me to get such a rush out of anything. The blood and adrenaline had blasted
their way through my body, making me feel slightly feverish and jittery. I took
a few more deep breaths until the phase subsided. When I felt well enough to
move around, I boosted myself off the wall and made my way deeper into the city.

I blended in perfectly with the hordes upon hordes of tourists who were roaming
through the hot summer streets, causing traffic jams galore. I bounced from
store to store, window shopping. I didn't find much value in spending my
earnings on clothes I'd either never wear or end up ripping. The food trucks,
construction, body odors, and occassional alleyway dumpsters made the city have
a unique peculiar smell, though after just having finished lunch, it was
slightly unsettling. Making my way through the maze-like grid of buildings, I
eventually ended up at the hotel.

----

The blaring of the alarm clock jolted me away. 8:00 P.M. I was lying on the
hotel bed, a book lying open, face down on my chest. I picked it up and plopped
it on the other side of the bed. Rubbing the drowsiness out of my eyes, I rolled
out of bed and into the bathroom. I brushed my teeth lazily - to get rid of the
nap breath - and then walked over to my bag on the TV counter. I brushed my hair
slowly with one hand while rummaging in the bag with the other. Taking out 2
long thin needles, I slid one into my hair to hold the bun in place and
carefully slid the other one into the fabric of my shorts. I sat back down on
the side of the bed, facing the door, waiting patiently for Fabian to arrive.

A few minutes later, around 8:20, I heard a knock on the door, and felt the
presence of a very familiar mind outside of it. I smiled to myself and went to
open the door, taking a deep breath before turning the knob.

"Oh, it's you!" I exclaimed, pretending to be surprised.

"I was just in the area and realized I was close by, and decided to be a bit
early." He said with a sly smile. "While I do prefer to be fashionably late,
being early is a wonderful twist, don't you think?"

*What. A. Fucking. Player.* "Sure it is! You caught me off guard though, I'm not
quite ready to have a guest in yet." I responded, giving him a slight smile.

He seemed to like that as he pushed the door open and walked in, making himself
comfortable on the bed.

"Oh-hoh! This is a pretty comfortable bed for a hotel. I'm impressed!" He said
as he laid down.

I gave him another smile and shut the door, locking the deadbolt as well.
Walking over, I slid over the foot of the bed like a lynx, an action that
induced a raised eyebrow and yet another sly smile from him.

"Ah, I don't believe we've introduced ourselves. My name is Fabian. My father
owns a few of the shopping streets here." *Fucking cocky-ass richboy.*

"Oh, you must be pretty loaded then, huh?" I asked, glancing quickly down at the
bulge that was forming in his pants. "In more ways than one, I see."

That seemed to give him quite the push. He sat up slowly, unbuttoning the top of
his shirt, and kicking off his shoes. "And what's your name, Miss? You're quite
the sight to behold, you know." "*And probably better with your clothes off.*"

*Damn, this guy is thirsty.* I giggled a bit. "Thanks, and I don't think telling
names in a one-night stand is necessary, is it?" I rubbed my neck, tugging the
collar of my shirt lower. *All things considered, this guy is easy as fuck.*

He gave a tiny shrug as he leaned in towards me, the scent of his cologne
polluting my airways. "I'm fine with that." He whispered in my ear. I put my
arms around his neck and leaned into his face. He took that as an invitation and
pressed his lips against mine, his hands finding their way under my shirt, and
up towards my breasts.

I winced a bit. *I'll have to take a really long shower after this one.* But
sacrifices have to be made if I wanted to play along. He started fondling them,
getting more aggressive as I continued to show a lack of resistance. I let out a
soft moan as his other hand went lower, going slightly under the waistband of my
shorts. I grabbed it, stopping his advances down south. *Bitch, that place ain't
for you.*

"Not yet. Let me do it first." I whispered to him, pushing his hand away and
inching my own up his leg. He smiled and nodded, leaning back and pulling his
pants down. To be honest, he was pretty well developed in that area. The bigger
it is, the bigger their egos, I guess. I rubbed his inner thigh with one hand,
pulling his pants all the way off with the other. It seemed to stand taller and
taller the more I touched him. After the slightest hesitation, I took it into my
mouth. *Shit, this is disgusting.*

"*Damn, this girl gives good head.*" His head went backwards as her

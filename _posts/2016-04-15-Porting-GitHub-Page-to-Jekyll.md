Well finally, I ported my GitHub page to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I've
been meaning to add a blog to my site, and wrote custom Python scripts to append
files and generate HTML pages. Dear god, this is so much nicer. Credit goes to
this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for leading me through
the process. Also, the site uses [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) now,
rather than custom CSS.
